[App Functionality Video Walkthrough] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDOIGnfXFbBVxUqxs_ObEhWPhmMXFyCZ/view?usp=sharing)

## Description

I created this app to help buisnesses manage a database that contains information about their departments, roles and employees. The app allows the user to view tables of existing data, to add new data, or update existing data. In creating this app, I was able to bring together my knowledge of building a command line app using inquirer and manipulating a database using MySQL. 

## Installation

In order to use the app, the user will need both Node.js and MySQL. [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) are instructions for installing Node. [Here] (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) are instructions for installing MySQL.

## Usage

To use the application, the user will first type index.js into the command line. The user will then be presented with a menu of options, which they can navigate using the arrow keys on their keyboard. When the user selects one of the options to view existing data, they will be presented with a table to view. When the user selects one of the options to add, or update data, they will be prompted with questions to answer. Once they've entered their responses, the database will be updated accordingly.
